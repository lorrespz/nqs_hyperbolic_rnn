This is the GitHub repo for the work arXiv: 2506.xxxxx, Hyperbolic recurrent neural network
as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz. 

In this work, we introduce hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) for quantum many-body systems in condensed matter physics. 
We investigate the viability and performance of hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz in 4 prototypical settings for many-body quantum physics: one-dimensional & two-dimensional transverse field Ising models, 
one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ models. In each of these 4 settings, hyperbolic GRU is benchmarked against different variants of Euclidean RNNs (either RNN or 
GRU), as well as against the exact results provided by DMRG (Density Matrix Renormalization Group) method. The results of running the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) experiments using hyperbolic GRU as well as Euclidean RNNs NQS ansatzes for each of the 4 settings are shown graphically below.
