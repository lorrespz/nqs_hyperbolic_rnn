as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz}

In this work, we introduce hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) for quantum many-body systems in condensed matter physics. 
We investigate the viability and performance of hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz in 4 prototypical settings for many-body quantum physics: one-dimensional & two-dimensional transverse field Ising models, 
one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ models. In each of these 4 settings, hyperbolic GRU is benchmarked against different variants of Euclidean RNNs (either RNN or 
GRU), as well as against the exact results provided by DMRG (Density Matrix Renormalization Group) method.
